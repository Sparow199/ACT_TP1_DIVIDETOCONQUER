# ACT_TP1_DIVIDETOCOQUER

The goal of this TP is to take charge of the "divide and conquer" paradigm and use it in
The complexity reduction context of an algorithm. In this lab we will concentrate
On the problem of the rectangle with a maximum area (see Figure 1), and thus develop
Solutions increasingly relevant in terms of algorithmic complexity.
